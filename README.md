### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

 I am Paul. I was born in 1987. By education I am a pharmacist, but since school  I have been interested in web developement. Back then I treated it as hobby. In november 2019 I decided to learn java script and I signed up for Future Collars' Front-end Develeper Bootcamp. (matters technology: html, css, flexbox, grid, sass, bootstrap, BEM methodology, js (es6) fundamentals, basics of React library).
 Next from February 2020 I studied in Localhost Academy. In July I had to stop because of birth of my lovely daughter :baby: :girl: Then I had less time to learn. 
 At that time I was burnishing better fundamentals of js, learning about functional programming, OOP, jest library and unit tests. 
 Since then I have been learning on my own in free time. I'm not going to give up and I will make my dream of becoming a programmer come true. :muscle:

âš¡ My other interests are:
* :books: reading books about personal growth, finance management 
* :movie_camera: watchig thrillers, documentaries and fantasy movies
* :evergreen_tree: hiking in the nature, especially in mountains

I encourage you to browse my repositories :blush: and to contact me ðŸ“« [pawel.sioda@gmail.com](mailto:pawel.sioda@gmail.com "My email") if you want to. 

Bye! ðŸ™‚
